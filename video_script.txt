1. Getting Started - Uploadcare Video Tutorial

Script:

Let's say you have a page with HTML form on your website,
with two fields and a file input. And you want to replace
the file input with the Uploadcare widget.

This is how the page source looks like. In this example
Twitter Bootstrap layout is used. And here is the
file input we want to replace.

First of all, you have to sign up at Uploadcare webste.
Go to Uploadcare.com, choose your plan, enter email
and password, and sign up for free. You can sign up
using your Google or GitHub account as well.

Now go to dashboard, and start a new project. The public
key for the project is generated automatically. Click
on "Widget" item in the menu, and scroll down to the "Integration"
section. There are 3 code snippets there; we need two of them:
the "script" tags to be placed in the head of HTML, and the widget
code.

Copy the first snippet, and paste it to your HTML page, just below
other "script" tags. Then copy second snippet, and replace
your file input tag with it.

That's it! File input is now replaced with Uploadcare widget.
Now drag and drop a file that you want to upload to the widget,
and upload will start immediately. You can continue filling form
data while the file is uploading. When you submit the form, a unique UUID of
the uploaded file is sent to your server. If autostore is configured
in the widget settings, which is default, the file will be placed directly
to the CDN. You can use the UUID of the uploaded file to retrieve it
from there.
